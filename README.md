Description

This notebook trains a CNN or pre-trained model to classify flowers.

Sample classes: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip.

Code covers:

Data loading and preprocessing

Model training

Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Prediction on new images

##Requirements
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pandas jupyter

##How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/CodeObsessed-1234/flower_detection.git
cd flower_detection


Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook main.ipynb


Follow the notebook steps to train and test the model.
